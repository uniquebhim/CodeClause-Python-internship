# Speed Typing Test in Python

Test your typing speed and accuracy with this simple Python program that measures how fast and accurately you can type a given text.

## How It Works 🚀

1. Run the Python script.
2. You'll be shown a text prompt to type. The text to type is provided in the script.
3. Press Enter when you're ready to start typing.
4. Start typing the provided text.
5. Once you finish typing, your typing accuracy, time taken, and words per minute (WPM) will be displayed.

## Running the Test 🏃‍♂️

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python speed_typing_test.py
   ```

## Example Output 📝

```plaintext
Type the following text:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
Press Enter when you're ready to start...
Start typing: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

Time elapsed: 13.84 seconds
Accuracy: 98.89 %
Words per minute: 28.66
```

## Customization 🛠️

You can customize the `test_text` variable in the script to change the text that you'll be typing during the test.
